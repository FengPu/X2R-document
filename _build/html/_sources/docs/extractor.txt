Extractor
=========


Extractor is a tool that extracts URIs from a given RDF file, and then turns these URIs into query terms. The purpose of Extractor is to find URI that cannot be reached in the given RDF. These URIs are usually generated by typical format translators and violate linked data design rules proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, i.e., they cannot be looked up in the Web. By generating query terms for them, other X2R tools, USS and UMS, can help in finding or minting better URIs.




Tokenizer
---------

Tokenizer is a major component of extractor. It aims to tokenize the tail of extracted URIs into word chuncks, which can be used as query terms to find better URIs.  

In X2R Extractor, a tokenizer should implement two methods, tokenizeArr(array $arr) and tokenizeStr($str).
