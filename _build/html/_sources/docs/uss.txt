URI Search Service
==================

URI Search Service (USS) 1.0 is monolithic, hard wired with the GUI and not take batch-mode search into consideration. In this revision, we conduct refactoring and introduce some flexibilities through several hooks. In the following paragraphs, the refactored USS is presented with several useful hooks.  


Refactored USS kernel
---------------------



Hooks
-----

In refined USS, seven **atomic hooks** can be replaced and extended, they are: 

* **Query Parser**

  Query Parser parses the plain text query string into set of query terms, term refinement qualifiers, result set qualifiers and corresponding integration commands.  

* **Endpoint Wrapper**

  Endpoint Wrapper wraps the public Endpoint, such as DBpedia, and handles the errors, such as Endpoint service downtime. Endpoint Wrapper accept SQARQL query and return the result set in standard format of Endpoint. 

* **Term Refiner**

  Term Refiner takes one query term as its input and output a refined query term.  

* **Result Ranker**

  Result Ranker reorder the ranks of result set based on the heuristic that it wants to realize. In addition to heuristic, Result Ranker can also be a crowd sourcing task, which can be delegated to the crowd. 

* **Result Filter**



..  (Term filters: filter some terms) Result Filter takes two input parameters: the filtered size and the result set. The filtered size, which determine the size of returned result set, sholud be larger than zero. The first ''filtered size'' results will be returned as the filtered result set. 




* **Result Integrator**

  Result Integrator takes two or more result sets and integrates them as one ranked result set. 

* **Result Selector**


Composition of atomic hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The atomic hooks can be composited through method chaining.
