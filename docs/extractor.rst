Extractor
=========

Extractor is a tool to extract URIs from a given RDF, and then turn these URIs into query terms. The purpose of Extractor is to find the opportunity of improving the quality of URI used in the given RDF. By generating query terms, other X2R tools, USS and UMS, can help in finding or minting better URIs.
